    "In order to implement the XGBoost algorithms the data must be preprocessed in a particular way - XGBoost requires an file that indicates which query each entry in the data frame comes from. If your training file is `train.txt`, the same folder should contain a file named `train.txt.group`, holding the group information. `train.txt.group` will contain a list of numbers indicating the number of feature vectors for each query, in the same order as the appear in `train.txt`. For example, if `train.txt.group` contained [7,8,5] we would know that there are 20 feature vectors in the training set and that the first 7 correspond to one query, the next 8 correspond to a different query and the final five are from a third query. \n",

XGBoost uses this query information both for building models and for evaluating the goodness of the models built.\n",
